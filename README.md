# Senhax
Password manager, with security and automatic backup.

# Background
This is a very simple and minimalist password management system for Linux. If you need a very basic shell tool, this is definitely an option. It's also a great tool for forgetting passwords and we use sqlcipher dependencies to provide greater database security.

The general functionality is inspired by the need to use key management and sharing, without any illusion of competing with more advanced systems for the same purpose.

The code is an attempt to provide a basic and simple to use method to enable secure password backup control and also simplifies the creation of working backups.
